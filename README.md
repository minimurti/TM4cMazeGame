# TM4cMazeGame
A graphical maze game which uses the two onboard buttons of a TM4C board and an LCD.

Here is an image of a toddler playing it

This uses the Tiva C series EK-TM4C123GXL LaunchPad evaluation kit from Texas Instruments, and the Kentec Display EB-LM4F120-L35 touchscreen LCD.

To run, open up the LAB474 workstation with IAR Embedded Workbench. I used version 8.11.3

This project was done as as my final project for EE 474 at University of Washington.
